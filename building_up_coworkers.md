A Key Strategy for Becoming Irreplaceable

## 1. The Power of One Question
To increase your value at work, there is one highly effective question you can ask anyone you work with:

**“What’s one thing I can do to make your job easier for you?”**

This question:
- Demonstrates genuine care  
- Builds trust and stronger relationships  
- Helps you understand what others truly need  
- Reveals actions that increase your value per hour  
- Applies to managers, coworkers, and direct reports  

Your value is strongly connected to **how easy you make life for the people around you**.

---

## 2. Asking the Question the Right Way
To use this strategy effectively:

### ✔ Ask Genuinely
The question must be asked with sincerity.  
The goal is to *help*, not to check a box.

### ✔ Ask Intentionally
Only ask if you are prepared to **act on the answer**.

---

## 3. Going Deeper with Follow-Up Questions
To ensure you fully understand the request, ask clarifying questions such as:
- “What does *‘on time’* mean to you?”  
- “How has this issue made your job more difficult?”  

This clarification allows you to:
- Understand expectations  
- Identify specific pain points  
- Commit to a concrete action  

---

## 4. Taking Action
After the conversation:

1. **Write down one specific action** you will take  
2. **Define when you will do it**  
3. **Follow through consistently**  

Reliable execution is what makes the question powerful.

---

## 5. Make It Part of Your Routine
Incorporate this question into:
- One‑on‑one meetings with your manager  
- Regular check‑ins with coworkers  
- Conversations with direct reports  

Ask it periodically to:
- Build stronger working relationships  
- Stay aligned with people’s evolving needs  
- Continually increase your value to the team

---

## 6. Summary

**“What’s one thing I can do to make your job easier for you?”**

Used regularly—and backed by consistent action—it:

# Identifying Coworkers’ Most Valuable Activities
A Collaborative Approach to Increasing Team Value

## 1. Why This Matters
Once you understand your own **Most Valuable Activities (MVAs)**, the next step toward becoming irreplaceable is helping others protect *their* MVAs as well.

Everyone has a unique set of MVAs. When coworkers support each other in staying focused on these high‑value activities:
- Overall team productivity increases  
- Everyone becomes more irreplaceable  
- Work becomes more aligned with strengths  
- Collaboration becomes more strategic  

Irreplaceability often happens faster **when two or more people support each other’s strengths**.

---

## 2. Get Buy‑In First
Before beginning this process:
- **Get approval from your manager or supervisor**  
- Ensure they understand what you’re doing and support the initiative  
- This builds trust and aligns expectations  

---

## 3. Have Coworkers Complete the MVA Process
Recommend that coworkers:
1. Learn what MVAs are  
2. Complete the same worksheet you used  
3. Identify and rank all their activities  
4. Determine their **top two MVAs**

After this step, both of you have:
- A list of work activities  
- Ratings (talent, replaceability, cost per hour)  
- Rankings  
- Clarity on your top MVAs and LVAs  

---

## 4. Compare Your Worksheets Together
Schedule a discussion to review your worksheets side by side.

### What to look for:
- **Overlap** in activities  
- Tasks you both perform  
- Opportunities to optimize the workload  
- Their LVAs that may align with your MVAs  
- Your LVAs that align with their MVAs  

### Example  
If your coworker’s **least valuable activity** is:
- Designing presentations  

…and one of your **MVAs** is:
- Graphic design  

This creates a natural opportunity for you to take responsibility for that task, freeing them to stay in their high‑value activities.

---

## 5. Redistribute Workload Strategically
After identifying crossover points:
- Discuss how tasks can be reassigned  
- Ensure changes benefit **both** of you  
- Focus on increasing the time each person spends in their MVAs  
- Seek balance and fairness  
- Document any agreed changes if needed  

Not every pairing will align perfectly, and that’s okay.  
The value comes from the **conversation and understanding**, not only from task swaps.

---

## 6. The Result: Mutual Irreplaceability
By going through this process:
- You understand your coworkers’ MVAs more clearly  
- You can support them in staying focused  
- They can support you in the same way  
- Your relationships strengthen through collaboration  
- Both of you become more valuable to the organization  

The better you understand and protect each other's MVAs, the more irreplaceable you both become.

---

## Summary
Identifying coworkers’ MVAs helps you:
- Strengthen working relationships  
- Reduce low‑value activities  
- Increase team efficiency  
- Support each other’s growth  
- Become collectively more irreplaceable  

Working together with clarity and intention leads to greater value for everyone involved.
# Creating a Plan of Improvement
A Collaborative Approach to Increasing Time Spent in MVAs

## 1. Purpose of the Improvement Plan
Now that you and your coworkers have:
- Identified your **Most Valuable Activities (MVAs)**  
- Understood each other’s MVAs through worksheet comparisons  

…it’s time to convert that insight into a **mutual improvement plan**.

The goal:  
**Help each other spend more time in MVAs and less time in LVAs — increasing value for both of you.**

---

## 2. Step 1 — Schedule a Dedicated One-to-One Meeting
Create a focused 50‑minute meeting with one purpose:

> **Support each other in increasing time spent in your Most Valuable Activities.**

This meeting should be intentional, structured, and collaborative.

---

## 3. Step 2 — Share and Compare MVA Worksheets
During the meeting:
1. Exchange your completed worksheets  
2. Look together for:
   - Overlapping activities  
   - Areas where **your MVAs = their LVAs**  
   - Areas where **their MVAs = your LVAs**  

Even if the alignment isn’t perfect, the comparison will reveal:
- Opportunities to support each other  
- Workload patterns  
- Strength-based task distribution possibilities  

---

## 4. Step 3 — Start by Helping Your Coworker First
Begin with an attitude of **giving**, not receiving.

Ask:
**“How can I help you remove some least valuable activities from your work schedule?”**

Use the **Order of Offloading** to structure your discussion:

### ✔ Improve personal systems  
Help them become more organized or efficient.

### ✔ Improve business systems  
Look at processes, documentation, workflows.

### ✔ Apply better technology  
Small upgrades often yield major time savings.

### ✔ Outsource (only when needed)  
The last resort — after systems and tools have been improved.

Your job is to help them stay in their MVAs **using the resources already available**.

---

## 5. Step 4 — Ask for Their Help in Return
Once you’ve focused on them, ask:

**“How can you help me spend more time in my MVAs?”**

This creates balance and ensures the meeting is mutually beneficial.

---

## 6. A Common Concern: “If everyone offloads LVAs, does any work get done?”
Yes — because:

> **One person’s LVA is often another person’s MVA.**

This process is not about removing work —  
It’s about **putting the right work in the right hands**.

People bring unique talents, strengths, and preferences.  
What drains one person’s time may energize another.

---

## 7. Step 5 — Make Concrete Commitments
Together, define:
- **What** specific actions each person will take  
- **When** you will take them  
- **How** you will support each other  

Document the commitments if needed to ensure clarity and follow-through.

---

## 8. Step 6 — Schedule a 30-Day Follow-Up Meeting
After 30 days:
- Review what worked  
- Identify what didn’t  
- Make adjustments  
- Refine the system  

This iteration is expected —  
**The goal is improvement, not perfection.**

Small steps over time lead to:
- More time spent in MVAs  
- Less time wasted in LVAs  
- Stronger working relationships  
- Increased value for both people  

---

## Summary
Creating a plan of improvement involves:
- Comparing MVA worksheets  
- Helping each other offload LVAs  
- Using the Order of Offloading  
- Making clear commitments  
- Reviewing progress after 30 days  

By working together and continuously refining your approach,  
you and your coworkers will **increase your value, efficiency, and career success**.
