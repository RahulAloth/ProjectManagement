# 📘 Study Notes: Stakeholders & Resource Identification in Project Management

---

## 1. Stakeholders Have Needs and Expectations

### 🧩 Who Are Stakeholders?
- A **stakeholder** is anyone **positively or negatively impacted** by a project.
- Project success strongly depends on stakeholder support.
  - PMI’s 2017 *Pulse of the Profession* survey found:
    - **62% of successful projects had actively supportive sponsors**.

### 🧭 Why Stakeholders Matter
- They are the people the project is ultimately for.
- Their support, engagement, and expectations directly influence outcomes.
- In project management, think: **Stakeholder, Stakeholder, Stakeholder**.

## 2. Tools to Identify Stakeholder Needs & Expectations

### 🛠 Tool 1: Stakeholder Analysis (Power–Interest Grid)

A visualization with **four quadrants**:

| Power | Interest | Approach |
|-------|----------|----------|
| High | High | **Manage Closely** — frequent engagement and communication |
| High | Low | **Keep Satisfied** — inform without overwhelming |
| Low | High | **Keep Informed** — update regularly, address concerns |
| Low | Low | **Monitor** — respond to issues as needed |

**Steps:**
1. Assess each stakeholder’s *power* and *interest*.
2. Place them into the correct quadrant.
3. Tailor communication accordingly.

### 🛠 Tool 2: Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix

Helps determine:
- **Current engagement level**
- **Desired engagement level**

Common engagement categories:
- Unaware  
- Resistant  
- Neutral  
- Supportive  
- Leading  

**Example:**  
- Stakeholder 3:  
  - *Current:* Unaware  
  - *Desired:* Supportive  

Use this gap to plan communication and engagement strategies.

## 3. Using Analysis to Manage Stakeholders
Once stakeholder information is collected:
- Develop a **communication plan**.
- Maintain engagement throughout the project.
- Continuously ensure expectations are addressed.

**Note:** Stakeholder management requires:
- Patience  
- Time  
- Active relationship-building  

But the payoff is a more successful project.

## 4. Identifying the Right Resources

### 🧰 What Are Project Resources?
Resources include:
- People  
- Equipment  
- Supplies  
- Materials  
- Capital  

Effective resource planning prevents project delays and bottlenecks.

## 5. Steps for Effective Resource Planning

### 1️⃣ Understand Project Scope
- Define and agree on scope.
- Break down the work using a **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**.

### 2️⃣ Identify Needed Resources
Use tools like a **Resource Breakdown Structure (RBS)**:
- Internal resources  
- External resources  
- Categorization prompts (e.g., human, material, equipment)

Ask:
- What skills are needed?
- How many resources?
- What specs (size, power)?
- When are they needed?
- Are they available?
- What % of their time can be committed?

### 3️⃣ Estimate Resource Time
Common estimating techniques:

| Technique | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Bottom-Up** | Estimate at lowest level, then aggregate upward |
| **Analogous** | Estimate using similar historical projects |
| **Parametric** | Use formulas based on historical data (e.g., cost per mile) |

### 4️⃣ Assign Resources to Tasks
- Coordinate with HR or functional managers.
- Work with procurement for physical resources.
- Ensure proper timing, quantity, and skill match.

### 5️⃣ Monitor Resources During Execution
- Regularly look ahead several weeks.
- Identify:
  - Who begins work soon
  - Required materials/equipment
  - Potential bottlenecks
- Adjust proactively to avoid delays.

## 🎯 Summary
Effective stakeholder management and resource planning are essential for project success. By understanding stakeholder expectations and ensuring availability of the right resources at the right time, project managers can prevent delays, maintain engagement, and deliver successful outcomes.
