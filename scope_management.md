# 📘 Study Notes: Scope Management & Ensuring Project Success

# 1. Avoid Scope Creep

### 🚨 What Is Scope Creep?
Scope creep occurs when **unplanned changes** are added to the project scope **without** going through formal change control.

It often happens through:
- Casual emails requesting new features  
- “Quick additions” discussed in meetings  
- Elevator or hallway requests  
- Messages implying “minor” changes  

These small, informal changes accumulate — suddenly the project is behind schedule, over budget, and overwhelmed.

## 🎭 Real-World Example
You're executing your project and someone tries to slip in a new requirement.  
Sure, meeting Brad Pitt would be nice — but **it’s not in the scope**.

These unofficial changes:
- Delay schedules  
- Increase costs  
- Strain resources  
- Add risk  
- Create confusion

# 2. How to Prevent Scope Creep

## 1️⃣ Develop a Scope Management Plan
A strong scope plan:
- Defines how scope is created and controlled  
- Establishes the **scope baseline**  
- Ensures stakeholders agree on scope  
- Requires formal processes for changes  

---

## 2️⃣ Create a Risk Management Plan
Risk planning helps:
- Identify potential risks early  
- Reduce the chance of unplanned changes  
- Clarify responsibilities and mitigation strategies  
- Allocate risk-related budget if needed  

---

## 3️⃣ Develop a Change Management Plan
This is your **best defense** against scope creep.

Your plan should:
- Require ALL changes to be submitted on a **change request form**  
- Reject any informal changes  
- Allow only approved changes to move forward  

**If no form is submitted → no change.**  
**If the form is submitted but denied → still no change.**

This simple rule:
- Standardizes change control  
- Protects the project  
- Sets clear expectations  
- Essentially eliminates scope creep

## 🔄 Change Request Workflow

1. Stakeholder submits a **Change Request Form**  
2. PM evaluates impacts on:
   - Scope  
   - Schedule  
   - Budget  
   - Resources  
   - Risks  
3. PM submits the analysis to the **Change Control Board (CCB)**  
4. CCB approves or rejects the request  
5. Only approved changes enter the project plan
