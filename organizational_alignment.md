# 📘 Study Notes: Organizational Alignment & Culture in Project Management

---

## 1. Identify and Align With Organizational Goals and Objectives

### 🎯 Why Alignment Matters
Projects must support corporate strategies and objectives. When they don’t:
- Resources are wasted.
- Time, money, and effort are misallocated.
- Projects fail to deliver meaningful organizational value.

**Key Insight:**  
If a project doesn’t tie directly to business goals → **Why do it?**

### 📊 Benefits of Strategic Alignment
According to PMI:
- Projects aligned with strategy are:
  - **69% more likely** to achieve business goals  
  - **50% more likely** to finish on time  
  - **45% more likely** to finish on budget  

Additional benefits:
- Increased organizational value  
- Stronger executive support  
- Eliminated waste and redundancy  
- Better resource allocation  

**Example:**  
A PMO review discovered **four teams unknowingly working on the same problem** → efficiency gained by consolidating efforts.

### 🧭 Ensuring Projects Align With Organizational Strategy

#### Questions a Project Manager Should Ask:
1. **Was this project approved through official channels?**
2. **Does it align with corporate strategy or objectives?**
3. **If not strategic, is it required for regulatory, legal, or safety reasons?**

Such compliance-related projects **must remain** in the portfolio even if not directly tied to strategy.

### 🤝 PM’s Role in Strategic Alignment
- Strategic planning may not be under your control.
- **But ensuring project alignment *is* your responsibility.**
- When alignment is clear, it's a **win‑win**:  
  - The organization benefits,  
  - The project gains support and relevance.

## 2. All Projects Are Influenced by Organizational Culture

### 🏢 What Is Organizational Culture?
An organization’s culture includes:
- Values  
- Norms  
- Beliefs  
- Attitudes  
- Assumptions  
- Habits  

These elements shape how projects are viewed and supported.

### ☀️ Culture’s Impact on Projects
Ask:
- Does leadership support project management?
- Is PM valued or seen as a “necessary evil”?
- Does the organization invest in PM processes and tools?

Strong PM culture → stronger foundations → higher success rates.
