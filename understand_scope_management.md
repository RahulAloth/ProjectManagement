# Study Notes

## 1. Understanding and Avoiding Scope Creep

### What Is Scope Creep?
Scope creep occurs when **unplanned changes** are made to a project **without following a formal change management process**.  
Common examples include:
- Change requests made casually over email or chat  
- Added requirements during meetings  
- Ad‑hoc requests made in passing (e.g., elevator conversations)
- Small “quick” changes that accumulate and cause delays

### Why Scope Creep Is a Problem
Scope creep negatively affects:
- **Schedule**
- **Budget**
- **Resources**
- **Risk exposure**

### How to Control Scope Creep
#### 1. Scope Management Plan
- Defines how scope is **developed, approved, and controlled**
- Includes the **scope baseline**
- Ensures all stakeholders understand that changes require a formal process

#### 2. Risk Management Plan
- Identifies potential risks upfront
- Defines strategies, roles, responsibilities, and cost impacts
- Reduces unplanned changes by planning for disruptions

#### 3. Change Management Plan
- Establishes a **formal change request process**
- Requires that **all changes must be submitted via a change request form**
- The project manager evaluates impacts before submission to a Change Control Board (CCB)
- Changes happen **only if approved**, preventing scope creep

## 2. Ensuring Project Success

- Maintain awareness and actively monitor project health
- Avoid repeating past mistakes
- Revisit learning materials whenever challenges arise
- Share experiences and learn from others
- Continuous learning contributes to project success

## 3. Discovering Your Most Valuable Activities (MVAs)

### Steps to Identify MVAs
1. **List Work Activities**  
   - Use broad categories (e.g., *sales*, *product development*)  
   - Avoid small tasks (*email*, *printing*, etc.)

2. **Rate Talent (0–10)**  
   - Based on your natural gifts, interests, and skills

3. **Rate Replaceability (0–10)**  
   - How difficult it would be to replace you for this activity

4. **Estimate Cost per Hour**  
   - What it would cost to outsource this activity  
   - Tip: Annual salary ÷ 2080 = hourly rate estimate

5. **Rank Activities**  
   - Combine insights from talent, replaceability, and cost  
   - Higher dollar-per-hour work typically ranks higher

### Calculate Time Spent on MVAs
- A = total weekly work hours (include travel and thinking time)
- B = time spent on top two MVAs  
- Percentage = B ÷ A  
**Goal:** increase this percentage over time

## 4. Avoiding Least Valuable Activities (LVAs)

### Understanding LVAs
- LVAs = low-skill, low-value, easily replaceable tasks  
- Examples: errands, printing, low-value meetings  
- MVAs = high-skill, high-value, strategic work

Think of your time like a glass:
- **Air = LVAs**  
- **Water = MVAs**  
Filling the glass with more MVAs leaves less room for LVAs.

### Why LVAs Are a Trap
- They’re easy, comfortable, and require little effort  
- Most people drift into them unconsciously  
- Over time they reduce your value

### Tools to Escape LVAs
#### 1. Ask: *“What is the value of this activity?”*
- Raises awareness  
- Helps avoid autopilot behavior  
- Consider tracking value (e.g., dollar/hour notes on your calendar)

#### 2. Ask: *“Why am I doing this?”*
- Reveals whether you drifted into the task or it was delegated  
- Helps avoid purely reactive work patterns

#### 3. Build a Strategy to Reduce LVAs
- Be intentional with your time  
- Focus on serving your role and career strategically  
- Replace LVAs with MVAs wherever possible

## Summary
- **Scope creep** undermines projects; prevent it with scope, risk, and change management plans.  
- **Project success** requires continuous learning and awareness.  
- **Most valuable activities (MVAs)** increase your irreplaceability—identify and maximize them.  
- **Least valuable activities (LVAs)** drain your time—recognize and avoid them.
