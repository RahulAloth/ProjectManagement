# Focusing with the Order of Offloading
A Practical Approach to Increasing Value and Reducing Low-Value Work

## 1. Why Focus Matters
Your success at work depends heavily on your ability to **be selective** about the activities you perform.

Think of your workday like a **hot air balloon**:
- Every activity (valuable or not) = another sandbag  
- A balloon weighed down with **15–20 different types of activities** struggles to rise  
- Reducing your activities to **4–5 key categories**, including your **two most valuable activities (MVAs)**, makes it easier to perform at a high level

The goal:  
**Reduce variety → increase focus → increase value per hour**

## 2. What *Not* to Do: The Order of Abdication
Many people try to eliminate tasks using a flawed, repetitive cycle:

1. Realize they lack time  
2. Adopt a tool/technology or hire help  
3. Discover the tool doesn’t solve the underlying problem  
4. Abandon the tool  
5. Return to step 1  

This loop wastes time and money because it avoids addressing the **real root cause**:  
their own systems, habits, and processes.

## 3. The Better Method: The Order of Offloading
Instead of reacting, the Order of Offloading provides a **structured, logical approach** to reducing workload effectively.

### Step 1 — Improve Your Personal Systems
Before removing tasks, optimize **your own workflow**:
- Get organized  
- Improve efficiency  
- Strengthen personal responsibility  
- Establish clear habits and time‑management practices  

> Fewer personal inefficiencies = fewer LVAs (Least Valuable Activities)

---

### Step 2 — Improve Business Systems
Business systems include:
- Procedures  
- Processes  
- Organizational structure  
- Documentation  

Questions to consider:
- Are the systems well‑documented?  
- Does everyone know their responsibilities?  
- Are you an expert in the systems that govern your work?  

Better business systems reduce unnecessary complexity and free up time.

---

### Step 3 — Use the Best Technology Available
After improving systems, add technology thoughtfully.

Examples:
- A computer older than **5 years** can slow productivity significantly  
- Small frustrations (slow printer, network issues, broken office tools) accumulate  
- Even a **2% slowdown** can equal **a full week of lost productivity per year**

The right tools → massive time savings.

### Step 4 — Outsource
Before committing to hiring:
- Try temporary help or freelance/contract support  
- Identify whether the workload justifies a permanent role  
- Understand the true needs of the function  

Outsourcing allows testing before long-term investment.

---

### Step 5 — Hire (Last Step)
Only after:
- Personal systems are strong  
- Business systems are efficient  
- Technology is optimized  
- Outsourcing has been tested  

…should hiring be considered.

At this stage, the foundation is strong enough for a new hire to succeed, and **your own value increases** because you are performing fewer LVAs and more MVAs.

## 4. Key Takeaways
- Reducing activity types improves focus and performance  
- Avoid the **Order of Abdication** — it wastes time  
- Follow the **Order of Offloading** to reduce workload intelligently  
- Make MVAs your priority; eliminate LVAs systematically  
- Professionals who follow this method become **much harder to replace**
